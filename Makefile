## --- proto codegen ---
# Go types are generated (via buf) into relay/internal/gleipnir/v1/ and committed.
# CI runs make proto-tools then make proto for the proto-drift check; Rust types are
# generated at cargo-build time by daemon/build.rs (tonic-build), so there is no
# Rust step here.  Run `make proto-tools` once before regenerating locally.
proto:
	cd proto && PATH="$$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$$PATH" buf generate

# Install the proto codegen toolchain at pinned versions (into $(go env GOPATH)/bin).
# Versions must match the committed generated code; @latest is intentionally avoided
# (protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest = v1.6.2 produces a spurious diff, false-positiving proto-drift).
proto-tools:
	go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.36.11
	go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.5.1
	go install github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf@v1.54.0

# Verify no committed generated code drifts from the proto source (ADR-0007).
# Runs proto (which regenerates) then fails if relay/internal/gleipnir/v1 differs.

## --- Relay (Go) ---
# Emit the actual `relay` binary (into the gitignored relay/bin/), not just a
# compile check. `go build ./...` validates but produces no artifact.

# test-integration is NOT part of the make test gate (hermetic suites only).
# Run explicitly: make test-integration
# Runs the mTLS smoke test (certless rejection) then the real-wire Go integration
# tests (//go:build integration) with the actual relay-daemon binary.
# Depends on build so both binaries exist before running.

## --- #112 dev-harness cross-binary CI machinery ---
# Kept OUT of build/test/lint: build-relay-devharness produces a non-shippable
# binary (the devharness dispatch/control backdoor, ADR-relevant — see
# relay/cmd/relay/devharness.go), and test-crossbinary needs both real
# binaries and is non-hermetic, matching the existing test-integration
# exclusion above.

# The devharness-tagged relay binary: never the shippable relay/bin/relay.
build-relay-devharness:
	cd relay && go build -tags devharness -o bin/relay-devharness ./cmd/relay

# Vet the gated files that the default (untagged) lint-relay never compiles,

# Mechanically proves the devharness surface is absent from the normal
# (untagged, shippable) relay binary and present in the devharness-tagged one.
devharness-absent-check:
	bash scripts/devharness-absent-check.sh

# The #112 acceptance test, plus the #103 fleet-semantics e2e suite (both
# real relay + real relay-daemon binaries over real loopback TCP, driven
# through the devharness control socket — the fleet suite additionally drives
# the real capability pipeline/Job engine, including a real Relay crash
# mid-Job, ADR-0004).
